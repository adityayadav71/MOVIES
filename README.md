# MOVIESX
- This Website uses the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch and display information related to movies and TV Shows.
- It can show movies and TV shows, that are trending today, upcoming in theatres, also data about celebrities born today, news from the box office, etc.
- We need to implement Google OAuth to identify and create users in database based on which the user can have access to their personal watchlist, to which they can add any movie or show of their choice.
- It uses the JavaScript fetch API to get the data, while PHP will be used for creating user sessions.
